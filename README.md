## Description
``` bash
React  Context api and Redux
```
## Prerequisites

``` bash
This shows the use of react Context Api and redux 

the src folder contais two folder of two same code but implemented an in redux and react context api
```



```bash
something to note Redux and React Cpntext api makes use of reducers in their boiler plate

so you need to know the poupular reducer fuctions



```

## Redux

```
Redux is one of the hottest libraries in front-end development these days. However, many people are confused about what it is and what its benefits are. As the documentation states, Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. To rephrase that, it’s an application data-flow architecture, rather than a traditional library or a framework like Underscore.js and AngularJS.

##  React Context api

```
The React context provides data to components no matter how deep they are in the components tree. The context is used to manage global data, e.g. global state, theme, services, user settings, and more.


The main idea of using the context is to allow your components to access some global data and re-render when that global data is changed. Context solves the props drilling problem: when you have to pass down props from parents to children.

On the other side, you should think carefully before deciding to use context in your application.

First, integrating the context adds complexity. Creating the context, wrapping everything in the provider, using the useContext() in every consumer — this increases complexity.

## Note
```
Redux is not related with React

Redux can be use with any Library that renders Ui on the browser
Redux can also be use with plain js
```

## Conclusion


```bash
You should not be in a rush to use Redux or react Context Api

beforeusing them make sure your project is significantly large



```
